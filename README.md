# About the data




## Cao 2017 L2 Larva Dataset (reprocessed)	
Cao and friends. [Comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profiling of a multicellular organism](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aam8940). Science 2017.

This was the first scRNAseq C. elegans data to be published. The single cell matrices used here were a newer version that was reprocessed and re-annotated and kindly provided by Robert Waterston and colleagues.

The technology used was sci-RNA seq. Two experiments with C. elegans at the L2 larval stage were performed with labels and cell counts as below. Their annotations define 117 cell types.

| Experiment name | Cells |

| L2_experiment_1 | 35480 |
| L2_experiment_2 |   507 |



## Packer 2019 Embryogenesis Dataset				
Packer and friends. [A lineage-resolved molecular atlas of C. elegans embryogenesis at single-cell resolution](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6459/eaax1971.long). Science 2019.

In the paper supplements, the way the age of the embryos was defined is described as follows:
>_Around 250,000 L1 larvae were 29 plated onto four 100 mm petri plates seeded with NA22 bacteria and allowed to develop at 20 30 Â°C. As the worms reached the young adult stage, the population was closely monitored. When 31 about 20-30% of the adults had a single embryo in either arm of the gonad, worms were 32 subjected to hypochlorite treatment. The time hypochlorite was added to the worms was 33 considered t = 0._ 

They used 10x Genomics v2 chemistry to profile 89,701 cells, split as below. Their annotations define 183 cell types.

## Taylor 2019 Neuron Dataset	

Taylor and friends. [Expression profiling of the mature C. elegans nervous system by single-cell RNA-Sequencing](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/737577v2). biorxiv 2019.

This is the first data release of the C. elegans Neuronal Gene Expression Map & Network (CeNGEN). The aim of the project is to establish a comprehensive gene expression atlas of an entire nervous system at single-neuron resolution, described in [the announcement publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.07.042). Their website is [cengen.org](https://cengen.org).

As described in their website: _We are performing 10x single-cell RNA-Seq on FACS-isolated neurons. Using 52,412 sequenced cells, 109/118 neuronal classes have been identified and computationally assigned to a cluster based on their gene expression fingerprint (93 confidently, 16 tentatively), and 9/118 classes have not been annotated yet._ 

They used 10x Genomics v2 and v3 chemistry to profile 65,450 cells from L4 stage larvae, split as below. Their annotations define 133 cell types.

## Ben-David 2020 L2 dataset

Ben-David and friends. [Whole-organism mapping of the genetics of gene expression at cellular resolution](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.23.263798) biorxiv 2020. 

In this dataset 5 separate 10x v2 lanes were run with about 10,000 L2 cells on each, each batch is a replicate. Their annotations define 99 cell types.

## Taylor 2020 Neuron Dataset	

Taylor and friends. [Molecular topography of an entire nervous system](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.422897). biorxiv 2019.

This is the second data release of the C. elegans Neuronal Gene Expression Map & Network (CeNGEN). The aim of the project is to establish a comprehensive gene expression atlas of an entire nervous system at single-neuron resolution, described in [the announcement publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.07.042). Their website is [cengen.org](https://cengen.org).

The data matrix used used here was from the original unfiltered 10x matrices as outputted by cellranger, I kept the same barcodes they kept but skipped the soupX processing step as I don't think removing background from the matrix itself is a sensible thing. 

They used 10x Genomics v2 and v3 chemistry to profile 100,599 cells from L4 stage larvae, split as below. Their annotations define 133 cell types.
