## Packer 2019 Embryogenesis Dataset				
Packer and friends. [A lineage-resolved molecular atlas of C. elegans embryogenesis at single-cell resolution](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6459/eaax1971.long). Science 2019.

In the paper supplements, the way the age of the embryos was defined is described as follows:
>_Around 250,000 L1 larvae were 29 plated onto four 100 mm petri plates seeded with NA22 bacteria and allowed to develop at 20 30 Â°C. As the worms reached the young adult stage, the population was closely monitored. When 31 about 20-30% of the adults had a single embryo in either arm of the gonad, worms were 32 subjected to hypochlorite treatment. The time hypochlorite was added to the worms was 33 considered t = 0._ 

They used 10x Genomics v2 chemistry to profile 89,701 cells, split as below. Their annotations define 183 cell types.
